# practical_python
Documenting my python journey.  I am a build/release engineer, competent in Perl.  I want to have the same competence in Python, but all the tutorials I've found so far are frustrating as heck - so very basic in approach and not really suited for addressing any of the problems I've solved in my earlier avatars.  Yes, I'll get there someday using this material and my knowledge might be encyclopedic, but the journey is boring.  So, making my own tutorial.  This will contain the most common actions I've had to do in scripts.

Step 1: Script with arguments
- sys module
- getopt module
- argparse module

Step 2: Find your current directory
